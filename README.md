# Facial Recognition using One Shot Siamese Network Scratch Implementation.

I developed a facial recognition system inspired by the Convolutional One-Shot Siamese Networks, transforming the concept from research paper to implementation. This system was utilized to create a project that showcased advanced machine learning concepts and practical applications in image recognition, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in real-world scenarios.

In general, we learn image representations via a supervised metric-based approach with siamese neural networks, then reuse that networkâ€™s features for one-shot learning without any retraining.

By using the strategies given in the paper OneShot - Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition.

I have implemented from the theoretical paper to system (code).
